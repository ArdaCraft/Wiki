## Relighter (ops only)

Forces the server to recalculate the sky light values for the given chunk(s).

| Command                                  | Description                                        | Notes               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `/relight`                        | Relight the chunk at the user's position           | (Player only)       |
| `/relight <chunk_radius>`         | Relight all chunks around the user's position      | (Player only)       |
| `/relight <x> <z>`                | Relight the chunk at the given block position      | (Player or Console) |
| `/relight <x> <z> <chunk_radius>` | Relight all chunks around the given block position | (Player or Console) |

Usage Notes:

-   Light calculations are relatively expensive so please make other users aware before running (it may cause lag).
-   Avoid using the likes of WorldEdit/Voxel tools during the relight operation.
-   The updated lighting may not be apparant when first visiting the re-lit chunk(s). Logging out and back in should fix this.
