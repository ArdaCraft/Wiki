ArdaCraft offers two ways to install and use the modpack: via the [launcher](#launcher) and [self-install](#manual)

## Launcher

The ArdaCraft launcher offers an easy way to install all the mods needed to enjoy playing on our server.

The launcher automatically installs the correct Java version, Forge, and mods for you so you just have to click and play!

#### Downloading:

Start off by downloading the launcher from our GitHub page:

- If you're on Windows grab the `.exe` [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/ArdaCraftLauncher/releases/download/v1.8.0/ArdaCraft-Launcher-setup-1.8.0.exe)
- If you're on Linux grab the `.AppImage` [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/ArdaCraftLauncher/releases/download/v1.8.0/ArdaCraft-Launcher-setup-1.8.0.AppImage)
- If you're on Mac (OSX) grab the `.dmg` [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/ArdaCraftLauncher/releases/download/v1.8.0/ArdaCraft-Launcher-setup-1.8.0.dmg)

**You may get a message that says this is not a trusted program or that it may be dangerous**

- If you're using chrome - click the up arrow next to the 'Discard' button and then click 'Keep'.

#### Install steps:

1.  Run the setup file.

-   Your antimalware software may think that this program is malicious. This is because it is written in Electron and not many antimalware software's can identify Electron applications.

2.  Once you run the setup.exe Windows might pop up with a message asking if you want to run the unrecognized app. Click `More info` and then click `Run anyway`.

3.  Choose your installation options - You can have the program work for all users of a computer, or just for your account.
4.  Click `Next` and choose your install location.
    -   Note that the ArdaCraft Launcher will default install to a folder called `.ardacraftlauncher` and `ArdaCraft Launcher` in your `C:\Users\%yourusername\AppData\Roaming` folder.
5.  Click `Install`.
6.  Make sure the checkbox next to `Run ArdaCraft Launcher` is checked and click `Finish`.

#### Using the Launcher:

1.  You will be greeted with a welcome message. Click the `Continue` button.

2.  Log in with your Minecraft account. This process uses the Mojang authentication service and we do not see any of your information.
    -   We do not support 'cracked' Minecraft accounts. If you do not own Minecraft - Buy the game [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition/)

3.  If you wish to change the launcher settings like how much ram the game will use click the gear/cog icon under your player name and go to `Java`.

4.  If you wish to change which mods you have installed, or install your own, click the gear/cog icon under your player name and go to `Mods`.

&NewLine;

5.  Click the `PLAY` button on the bottom right. The launcher will install everything and auto join you to the ArdaCraft server!

6.  If you do not have Java installed - the launcher will have a pop-up asking to install it for you.

#### I ran into issues!

- If your launcher gets stuck at 100% after hitting the `PLAY` button. Exit the launcher, relaunch it, and try again.
- If your game is really slow try adding more RAM in the launcher settings menu.
- If you run into an issue press `Ctrl` and `Shift` and `i` keys at the same time. This will bring up the html editor. Click the Console tab on the top. Right click anywhere in the log and click `Save as...`. Post your issue and the log file to our #Support channel on Discord.

## Manual

If you prefer to use the default Minecraft Launcher, or have troubles with the ArdaCraft Launcher, you can do a self-install.

-   You can download the mods yourself, or download the mods used in our launcher [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/modpack/releases).

1.  First install [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) for Minecraft 1.12.2.
2.  Run Minecraft with the Forge profile enabled.
3.  Download Conquest Reforged [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/conquest-reforged/files)
4.  Put the `ConquestReforged-mc1.12.2.jar` in your Minecraft's `mods` folder.
5.  Download Optifine for 1.12.2 [here](https://optifine.net/downloads).
6.  Put the `OptiFine_1.12.2.jar` into your Minecraft's `mods` folder.
7.  Download the ArdaCraft Resource Pack [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/AC_Overlay/releases/latest) as well as the Conquest Resource Pack [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/conquest-reforged-resource-pack/files) and put them in your `resourcepacks` folder.
8.  Once you are on the main menu screen, go to `Options` then `Resource Packs...` and move the `AC_Overlay.zip` file above the `Conquest Reforged.zip`
    -   This is what your Resource Packs page should look like:

9.  You now have everything you need to join the server. The IP is `mc.ardacraft.me`.
